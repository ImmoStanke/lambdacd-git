# Git support for LambdaCD

Provides Git support for [LambdaCD](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd).
Will replace the `lambdacd.steps.git` namespace in the the lambdacd-git library.

## Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd-git.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flosell/lambdacd-git)

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lambdacd-git/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lambdacd-git)

This library is under development and no stable version has been released yet.

## Usage

```clojure
;; project.clj
:dependencies [[lambdacd-git "<most recent version>"]]
;; import:
(:require [lambdacd-git.lambdacd-git :as lambdacd-git])
```

### Complete Example

You'll find a complete example here: [example/simple_pipeline.clj](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd-git/blob/master/example/lambdacd_git/example/simple_pipeline.clj)

### Waiting for a commit

```clojure
(defn wait-for-git [args ctx]
      (lambdacd-git/wait-for-git ctx "git@github.com:flosell/testrepo"
                     :branch "master"
                     :ms-between-polls 1000))
```

### Cloning a Repository

```clojure
(defn clone [args ctx]
  (lambdacd-git/clone ctx repo branch (:cwd args)))

(def pipeline-structure
  `(; ...
    (with-workspace
      clone
      do-something)))
```

### Get details on commits since last build

```clojure
(defn clone [args ctx]
  (lambdacd-git/clone ctx repo branch (:cwd args)))

(def pipeline-structure
  `(wait-for-git
    (with-workspace
      clone
      lambdacd-git/list-changes
      do-something)))
```

### Working with more than one repository

You can have clone steps that clone into different subdirectories: 

```clojure
(defn clone-foo [args ctx]
  (core/clone ctx repo branch (str (:cwd args) "/" "foo")))
(defn clone-bar [args ctx]
  (core/clone ctx repo branch (str (:cwd args) "/" "bar")))

(def pipeline-structure
  `(; ... 
    (with-workspace
      clone-foo
      clone-bar
      do-something)))
```

If you want to use this in combination with `wait-for-git`, you need to detect which commit to use. For details, see
[example/multi_repo_pipeline.clj](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd-git/blob/master/example/lambdacd_git/example/multi_repo_pipeline.clj)
